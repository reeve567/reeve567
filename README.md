### Hi ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Software Engineer with a love for learning (and Kotlin, specifically)

Any libraries/images/etc. can be found usually on my nexus repo -> https://repo.reeve.dev

I'm currently (painfully) learning Rust

My favorite projects include ones that bring together different technologies, especially when it makes lives easier

Below you can find some of my contributions and projects that I've made public :)
